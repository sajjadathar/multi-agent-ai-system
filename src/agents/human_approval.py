src/agents/human_approval.py

Human-in-the-loop approval node.

This node sits between the Curriculum Planner and the Explainer.
It pauses the graph and waits for the user to approve (or reject)
the study roadmap before any studying begins.

How interrupt() works:
  1. LangGraph reaches this node
  2. interrupt() is called, graph execution PAUSES here
  3. LangGraph saves a full checkpoint to SQLite
  4. Control returns to the caller (main.py)
  5. main.py shows the roadmap and collects user input
  6. main.py calls graph.invoke(Command(resume=user_input), config)
  7. Execution resumes HERE with decision = user_input
  8. Node returns state update based on decision

Why this matters for production:
  In a web app, steps 4-6 would be:
    4. HTTP response returned to browser with the roadmap
    5. User submits a form
    6. New HTTP request resumes the graph
  The LangGraph code is identical in both terminal and web mode.
  Only the input collection mechanism changes.

    When approved=False, the conditional edge routes back to the
