graph/state.py

Shared state definition for the Learning Accelerator.

This is the single most important file in the project.
Every agent, Curriculum Planner, Explainer, Quiz Generator,
Progress Coach, reads from and writes to this state.

LangGraph checkpoints this entire object to SQLite after every
node execution, which is how the system survives crashes and
supports human-in-the-loop approval flows.

Key design decisions documented inline.

#
# AgentState is the TypedDict that LangGraph manages.
# Every node in the graph receives the full state and returns
# a partial update (only the keys it changed).
#
# Why TypedDict and not a regular class?
#   LangGraph requires dict-compatible objects. TypedDict gives us
#   type safety while staying dict-compatible.
#
# Why inherit from TypedDict directly instead of using a subclass trick?
#   LangGraph 1.x works cleanly with TypedDict. No need for workarounds.
